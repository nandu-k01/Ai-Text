# Ai-Text


## Overview
This project is a text generation application powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It allows users to enter a prompt or topic and generate text based on that input. The application uses OpenAI's API to communicate with the GPT-3 language model, and provides a simple graphical user interface for users to interact with. The user interface is built using the PyQt5 framework in Python, and the code is available on GitHub for anyone to download and run on their own machine.

## !!
Replace openai.api_key with your own API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys in the app.py file
